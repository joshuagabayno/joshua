                        <p> The Philippines Mental Health Association (PMHA) declared a rising epidemic of mental health crisis in the Philippines, citing a sharp increase in concerns after the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.  They highlighted limited access to mental health services due to stigma and scarce resources, with less than one mental health worker per 100,000 Filipinos.  The PMHA called for a whole-of-society approach and greater accessibility to diagnosis, treatment, and care.  This situation underscores the urgent need for stronger and more localized mental health responses in the country.</p>

                        <p>A study by the National Maritime Polytechnic (NMP) revealed a rise in mental disorders among Filipino seafarers, with cases increasing from 23 in 2018 to 64 in 2022.  Anxiety and depressive disorders were most common, and suicide cases rose from one in 2018 to nine in 2022.  The pandemic exacerbated mental health issues, with isolation and extended contracts contributing to increased stress. Seafarers aged 30 to 39 were most affected by these issues.</p>

A DOH study found that one in three COVID-19 patients developed a mental health condition within six months.
